			<p>This is a Meatloaf recipe for people who love their <em>Meatloaf oozing with flavour</em>, moist and tender yet not crumble apart when sliced, and a sticky caramelised meatloaf glaze.
			Itâ€™s so much more than just a giant hunk of ground beef in a loaf shape!</p>

					<ul>Ingredients</ul>
					<li>1 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
					<li>1 large onion</li>
					<li>1 kg / 2 lb ground beef (mince)</li>
					<li>2 eggs</li>
					<li>3 garlic cloves </li>
					<li>1 tsp Worcestershire Sauce</li>
					<li>1/4 cup tomato ketchup</li>
					<li>1/4 cup chopped parsley</li>
					<li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
					<li>2 beef bouillon cubes</li>
					<li>1 tsp black pepper</li>

					<ol>Instructions
					<li>Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Oil or spray a loaf tin. (Note 3)
					<li>Glaze: Mix together in a small bowl. Set aside.
					<li>Meatloaf: Place breadcrumbs in a very large bowl. Grate over onion. Mix so the breadcrumbs are all wet. (Note 4)
					<li>Add remaining ingredients. Mix well using your hands. Form into a loaf shape, pinching together then smoothing over creases and cracks (helps prevent cracks during baking).
					<li>Transfer into loaf tin. Brush generously with glaze, using about 1/2.
					<li>Bake for 45 minutes. Remove from oven and brush with most of the remaining glaze. If there is excess fat pooling, scoop/pour it off.
					<li>Bake for a further 30 minutes. Remove from oven.
					<li>Stand for 10 minutes before turning out and cutting into thick slices. You will probably get a bit of crumbling just on the edges of the first couple of slices, this is normal and indicative of the tenderness of the meatloaf (zero crumble indicates firm packed harder meatloaf which isn't as enjoyable!).
					<li>Ideal served with a dollop of ketchup, creamy mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables.</li></ol>
